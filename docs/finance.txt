  of goods sold is called expense. Surplus of revenue over expense is called income. For example:

     mentioned books of original entry.

  nature, are opened and maintained. A ledger account may be defined as a summary statement of all 
  the transactions relating to a person, asset, expense, or income or gain or loss which have taken
  place during a specified period and shows their net effect ultimately. When transactions take
