  of goods sold is called expense. Surplus of revenue over expense is called income. For example:
  If goods costing Rs. 4,00,000 are sold for Rs. 5,00,000, the sale amounting to Rs 5,00,000 is
  revenue, cost amounting to Rs 4,00,000 is expensevnad the difference between the two i.e.

  order and from which they are posted to the ledger accounts at any convenient time. Journalsing
  refers to the act of recording each transaction in the journal and the form in which it is 
  recorded, is known as a journal entry.

* Sub-dvision of Journal: When innumerable number of transactions takes place, the journal, as the
  sole book of the original entry becomes inadequate. Thus, the number and the number and type of
  journals required are determined by the nature of operations and the volume of transactions in a
  particular business. There are many types of journals and the following are the important ones:

  4. Sales Returns Day Book- to record the return of goods sold to customers on credit.
  5. Purchases Returns Day Book- to record the return of goods purchased from suppliers on credit.
  6. Bills Receivable Book- to record the details of all the bills received.
  7. Bills Payable Book- to record the details of all the bills accepted.
  8. Journal Proper-to record all residual transactions which do not find place in any of the
     mentioned books of original entry.
  

* Ledger: Ledger is a main book of account in which various accounts of personal, real and nominal 
  nature, are opened and maintained. A ledger account may be defined as a summary statement of all 
  the transactions relating to a person, asset, expense, or income or gain or loss which have taken
  place during a specified period and shows their net effect ultimately. When transactions take 
  place, they are first entered in the journal and subsequently posted to the concerned accounts in
  the ledger. Posting refers to the process of entering in the ledger the information given in the
  journal.

     This ledger is also known as sales ledger.
  2. Creditors’ Ledger: It contains accounts of all suppliers from whom goods have been bought on
     credit. From the Purchases Day Book, Purchases Returns Book and Cash Book, the entries are made 
     in this ledger. This ledger is also known as Purchase Ledger.
